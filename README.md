#Testing using the Selenium framework and Junit

If using linux or windows:
Download os-specific chrome driver here: https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.43/

Place chromedriver in the webdrivers folder and link its absolute path in the @BeforeClass method.

Make sure to give it permission to execute (chmod 755 on unix, windows not sure).
